==========Items=============

#Battery Packs 
	- Robot "Food" 
	- Durability based charge 
	- Both single use and rechargable varient

==========Factions=============

-Spacer tech neutral and raider factions 
-Quests? 
	

==========Other Random Stuff=============
- Turn non humanoids into robots, make your pets experience the certainty of plasteel

- Extendable graphics variants for robotic presenting vs organic presenting pawns (e.g if i make a robot with modded race as a base, i should be able to make an addon mod with a robotized version of the race, which will be automatically swapped over if i choose to make it robotic presenting)


==========Psycast=============

VPE and RWoM each have their own Tech themed psycast trees, I want to have less overlap 
Probably as a sub mod

#Disruption pulse 
	- Shuts down bionics on bio pawns, including death acidifiers (damages archotech bionics)
	- Stuns mechanical pawns + damages random components 
	
#Overclock 
	- Increase work speed of mechanical pawns 
	- Increases part efficiency of bionics 

#Mech drop 
	- Spawns mechanoid drop pods at target position
	- Mechanoids are hostile to any non-mechanoids
	
#Optical Cloak 
	- Makes target invisible to mechanical pawns, and pawns with bionic eyes
	
#Decode
	- Removes biocoding from target weapon 
	
#Weapon Jamming
	- Weapons of high tech and above may randomly jam while firing
	- Has a chance of exploding 
	
#Deconstruct 
	- Short range 
	- Turns target back into raw materials
		- Deconstructs buildings 
		- Uncrafts items if possible
		- Butchers target pawn  
		
#Flux Dump 
	- Converts neural heat to energy and can be dumped into batteries or mechanical pawn energy buffers.
	- Can overfill hostile mech pawns for explosion
